Take fits files:
	Median filter the data points
	Background Subtraction (save background values)
	Save new fits files, never do this again
	Calculate centroids, save them in a file, never calculate again

From cleaned up fits files:
	get 3x3, 5x5 etc pld files of normalized flux
	Try also, median stack all the frames, take pixels that contain 90% of the flux (or some other value)
	Save this data, never calculate it again

Now, calculate flux with varius apertures from clean fits files

Files that exist now:
	cleaned up fits files
	backgrounds
	centroids
	pld pixel data
	flux as a function of aperture




Pre-Process:
	Median Filter
	Calculate and subtract background (using annulus, and corner)
	Calculate centroids (save as individual file, two columns one for 2dgauss one for CoL)
	Save one big file:
		Columns: background, 2dGauss centroid, CoL centroid
	save filtered and subtracted images as new file (fits or just )

	Also, save median stacked image, mean stacked image


Some things to output:
	t0, start time of observation (in BJD?, whatever it is in the fits file)
	% of points median filtered
	List of frames where 2dgaussian fit was bad
	





Getting flux will be different stuff (since I might want to go back and try different things)
